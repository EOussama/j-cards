## Description
Simple card flipping collection made to personally help me better memorize Japanese (Hiragana) characters. With a press of a button, you can flip cards around, and reveal the correct translation of the focused Hiragana characters.
This mini-project is highly influenced by [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)'s [Tinycards](https://tinycards.duolingo.com/) education platform, specifically, [this collection](https://tinycards.duolingo.com/decks/e1fhs/writing-japanese-hiragana).
